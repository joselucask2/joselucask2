- ðŸ‘‹ Hello world!
- ðŸ‘€ My name is JosÃ© Lucas, I am 19 years old and I am currently an undergraduate student in the higher course of systems analysis and development
at university City of SÃ£o Paulo - UNICID.  
I'm starting to program in Python, but I aim to develop into more languages...
I am very eager to share knowledge and learn through this platform!
I am available to participate in projects.
